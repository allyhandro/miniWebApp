                <p>Hello. My name is Ronaldo. You may or may not have heard of me. It is my sword duty to traverse the odds and ends of this beautiful town we call Beach City to find everything <em>out of the ordinary</em>. It is a dangerous mission that only someone of my outstanding moral caliber can accomplish. I alone am responsible for teaching the noble residents of Beach City as well as the <em>entire world</em> the beauty and wonderous splendor found here.</p>
                <p>There are things happening in Beach City that are <strong>not</strong> normal. This paranormal activity shouldn't be seen as a danger, oh no, but as a <strong>feature</strong> of our beautiful city. We must all work together to keep Beach City the whimsical place it is.</p>
